# A Conformal Cyclic Cosmology Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based mathematical model of the Infinite Universe Cycle, specifically exploring the framework of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC). The project simulates the transition between cosmic aeons, examining the universe as a self-sustaining physical system governed by logic and chemical processes.

## Inspiration and Background

This research is rooted in an interest in the intellectual debate between theism and atheism. As a lifelong atheist, my approach is grounded in the belief that the mysteries of existence are best solved through physics, chemistry, and computational logic rather than traditional doctrine. 

My inspiration evolved through three primary stages:
1. **Intellectual Inquiry:** Analyzing the theism vs. atheism debate led to a fascination with the "First Cause" problem and the search for a purely logical, infinite model of the universe.
2. **Computational Logic:** Recognizing that if the universe can be modeled as a recurrent system, then intelligence and AI are the ideal tools to test the validity of these cycles.
3. **Responsible AI Development:** As an ICT major at Fontys University Eindhoven, I am committed to developing AI that serves as a tool for scientific discovery. My objective is to build systems that prioritize transparency and safety, ensuring that AI remains a benefit to humanity rather than a weapon of mass destruction.

## Simulation Framework
The simulation utilizes the Friedmann Equations to model cosmic expansion and implements the following core concepts:
- **Exponential Expansion:** Modeling the role of Dark Energy in the late-stage universe.
- **The Massless Limit:** Simulating the decay of matter to radiation, a prerequisite for the CCC transition.
- **Conformal Rescaling:** Mathematically bridging the infinite future of one aeon into the initial conditions of a subsequent Big Bang.

## Research Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to create a testing ground for entropy carryover and information residue across cosmic cycles. By simulating these transitions, we can better understand how to align complex AI models with the fundamental laws of nature.

## Technical Specifications
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Environment:** Compatible with Google Colab and local Python 3.x installations.
