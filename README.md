This project is a Python-based mathematical model of the **Infinite Universe Cycle** (Conformal Cyclic Cosmology). It explores the transition between cosmic aeons, treating the universe not as a one-time event, but as a self-sustaining physical system.

## 💡 The Inspiration: From Belief to Logic

My journey into this research began with a shift in perspective:
1. **Deconstructing Tradition:** Moving away from religious explanations toward a framework grounded in **chemistry, physics, and logic**. 
2. **The AI Lens:** I became fascinated by the possibility of the universe being a "recurrent system." If intelligence can be modeled and reset, why not the universe itself?
3. **The ICT Ambition:** As an ICT major at Fontys University Eindhoven, my goal is to develop AI that serves as a tool for discovery rather than a weapon. I believe that by scaling AI responsibly, we can finally solve the mathematical puzzles (like entropy and the Big Bang) that have eluded human researchers for centuries.

## 🛠️ The Simulation Logic
The core of this project is the **Aeon Transition**. 
- It simulates the exponential expansion of space using the **Friedmann Equations**.
- It implements a **Conformal Rescaling** function that bridges the "infinite future" of one aeon into the "Big Bang" of the next.
- It provides a testing ground for how **Information Residue** (entropy) might carry over across cycles.

## 🛡️ Ethics and AI Alignment
This project is built with the philosophy that AI should be a "Guardrail for Humanity." By using AI to simulate the most complex system in existence—the Universe—we can learn how to build safer, more aligned models that prioritize logic, sustainability, and life.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Core simulation engine.
- **NumPy & Matplotlib:** Mathematical analysis and visualization.
- **Google Colab:** Initial research environment.
